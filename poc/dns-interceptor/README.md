# DNS Interceptor POC - Now Viable with Recent Simplifications

## Overview
This proof-of-concept demonstrates how a local DNS server could replace hosts file modification for Postman SAML enforcement. Recent simplifications to the daemon architecture make this approach much more feasible than it was previously.

## Why This is Now Viable

The recent architecture changes fundamentally enable DNS interception by moving from complex IdP-specific configuration to a single `saml_init_url` field. We now construct SAML URLs directly from the full configured URL rather than building them from individual components. The removal of state machine complexity and unnecessary abstractions creates a unified approach where the same configuration pattern works across all IdP types.

These simplifications make DNS interception viable because the daemon eliminates hosts file modification while maintaining the same port 443 operation that applications expect. The SSL termination requirements remain identical, and the SAML logic uses the simplified redirect approach we just implemented. Most importantly, disabling the system becomes much cleaner since you stop a DNS server rather than editing system files.

## Architecture
```
Client (Postman)
    |
    | DNS Query: identity.getpostman.com
    v
Local DNS Server (port 53) ──> Returns: 127.0.0.1
    |
    v
SAML Daemon (port 443) ──> Uses simplified redirect logic
    |
    v
Direct redirect to saml_init_url with preserved parameters
```

## Implementation Notes

The key insight from recent simplifications is that the daemon now uses a straightforward approach where it takes the configured SAML init URL directly:

```python
# Use configured SAML init URL directly  
base_saml_url = self.config.get('saml_init_url', 'https://identity.getpostman.com/sso/saml/init')
```

This architectural change makes DNS interception viable because there's no complex URL construction logic to replicate in the DNS server component. The system simply preserves parameters and appends them to the base URL, using a single configuration field instead of multiple IdP-specific settings.

The DNS server component would need to intercept queries for `identity.getpostman.com` and return `127.0.0.1` for that specific domain while forwarding all other queries to upstream DNS servers like 8.8.8.8. Running on port 53 requires administrative privileges, but this is the same privilege level already needed for certificate trust.

The benefits compared to the current approach include elimination of hosts file modification as the primary goal, along with more standard network interception methods that are easier to automate during deployment. The uninstall process becomes cleaner since you stop a service rather than restoring modified files.

## Why Previous DNS Attempts Failed

Before the recent simplifications, DNS interception was prohibitively complex because multiple configuration parameters needed reconstruction using intricate IdP-specific URL building logic. The state machine complexity made replication of the daemon's behavior extremely difficult for a separate DNS server component.

## Current Viability

With the simplified architecture, DNS interception becomes practical because of the single `saml_init_url` configuration that enables direct URL usage with simple parameter appending. The minimal logic required makes it feasible to replicate the essential behavior in a DNS server component.

## Implementation Status

This POC folder is prepared but not fully implemented, as the recent daemon simplifications make this approach newly viable. Implementation would involve creating a Python DNS server that intercepts specific domains, using the existing simplified daemon on port 443, and configuring system DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 for testing.

## Recommendation

While the recent simplifications make DNS interception a viable alternative to hosts file modification, the Zscaler Client Connector POC demonstrates a more enterprise-friendly approach. The Zscaler approach doesn't require system DNS changes, uses standard proxy configuration methods, and leverages existing enterprise infrastructure that organizations already have deployed.

## Next Steps

If DNS interception becomes necessary, implementation would involve creating a Python DNS server using libraries like `dnslib`, copying the simplified daemon logic for SAML redirects, testing system DNS configuration on macOS, and comparing the ease of deployment against the current hosts file approach. However, the enterprise proxy approach demonstrated in the Zscaler POC likely provides better integration with existing organizational infrastructure.
